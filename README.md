# How it works
All your commit messages are stored inside `~/.statusupdate` folder, grouped by day.

```
$ ls ~/.statusupdate
13002020 14002020 15002020
```

When you run `node ~/path/to/standup/status_update.js`, it find the recently modified file and outputs updates from it.

# Todo
â€“ [ ] View updates by selected date
- [ ] Auto clean updates older than 30(or N) days
